Most of the time, however, a coding standard is something we develop on our own after we realize that patterns and practices helps us understand our code and the code of other developers. Here I’m sharing what I have found works for me and might work for others also.",
    "Post": "<p>​My idea of a short and simple coding standards that most of us can agree on:</p><p><b>Methods:</b></p><p>Should be named using PascalCase.</p><p>Names should be verbs or verb phrases: RemoveAll(), GetMembers().</p><p>Parameters should be named using camelCase.</p><p><b>Variables:</b></p><p>Should be named using PascalCase when the scope is outside a method.</p><p>Should be named using camelCase when the scope is within a method.</p><p>Do not use abbreviations. Use descriptive names.</p><p>Do not use Hungarian notation.</p><p>Use the <b>var</b> type whenever possible.</p><p><b>Format:</b></p><p>Methods should be separated by a line-space.</p><p>Trim unnecessary spaces from the code.

The software will blow your mind.</p><p>I use it every day to monitor my sleep, my heart rate, my exercise routines, the amount of calories I burn, my messages and my calendar reminders among many other things. The MS Band connects to my Lumia 925 Windows 8.1 phone via Bluetooth, and syncs with my Microsoft Health application providing me with plenty more information regarding my daily activities.  The phone app also manages my Band settings giving me options to customize the look, and allows me to add or delete notification tiles. And, oh yeah before I forget: the MS Band also syncs with Android and Apple phones.</p><p>There are plenty of reviews, pictures, and videos online that you can watch if you’re interested in finding out more.  Here is a link to a video that I like: Microsoft Band hands-on. If you want to read online reviews you will find that most of them will score the Band four-out-of-five stars. Here are a couple of reviewers that were not very impressed: <br/><br/>Microsoft Band: Killer on the inside, 'meh' on the outside<br/>Microsoft Band Review: Tracks Your Every Move, Then Breaks Your Heart</p><p>Is the MS Band perfect? No.  Can it be improved? Yes, and I’m sure that it will be. In my book it certainly deserves a five star rating.  Interested?

Microsoft just upgraded my free Office Lens Windows Phone App and it does exactly that plus more.</p><p>Recently I have been involved in a project of publishing a book that is currently in print form to the web. The process involved in creating the web page is: Scan the document, convert it to PDF format, open the document with a PDF reader, copy sections of text from the PDF document into a Word document, then proof the document, format, save as text, and copy the text to an HTML page. With Office Lens I no longer need the scanner, and I don’t have to copy and paste to Word; now I just take a picture and save it as a Word document. I still need to do the proofing, formatting, and HTML but the fact that I don’t need a scanner is worth plenty – at least to me.</p><p>Saving your pictures to Word document is only one of the features. Office Lens will also save your pictures as OneNote documents, and diagrams can be saved as PowerPoint files. I now have an OCR scanner in my pocket. If you don’t have Office Lens installed on your phone go ahead and get it now – it’s free – from this website: Office Lens App for Windows Phone</p><p>I haven’t tried the PowerPoint option but the OneNote and Word capabilities work surprisingly well.

    "Post": "<p>It’s been a while (more than 15 years) since I registered the domain name familiagaxiola.com and created a website for the Gaxiola surname. A couple of years later the domain name gaxiolafamily.com became available and I immediately added it to my account. The website has been going through stages and changes ever since inception. Sometimes the process has to do with me, sometimes it has to do with technology, and sometimes is time and resources, but most of the time it’s just life getting in the way of progress – or maybe progress getting in the way of life; I’m never sure what gets in the way of what. But, the fact of the matter is that this website is never, ever, going to be completed to my satisfaction.</p><p>Nevertheless, this time I’m making the following commitment: The website will meet the following requirements before the end of the year:<br/>The website is to be a central hub for the Gaxiola surname<br/>With five sections: Reunions, Blogs, News, Business, Pictures, Social Media, and Memoriam.<br/>The site is to be responsive, fluid, and fast.</p><p>Short and simple. Something that can actually be accomplished this year if life allows it. And something that I would like to accomplish with some help from family and friends.</p><p>For this reason I have created the following Trello board (link at the bottom of this post) so that anybody that wants to help can help by adding their voice to the process, and by guiding me in the right direction. You want to help with development? Go to <a href='https://github.com/abelgaxiola/gaxiola' target='_blank'>https://github.com/abelgaxiola/gaxiola</a> and issue a pull request. You can also follow @familiagaxiola on Twitter and Facebook. And this should go without saying: the best way that anyone can help is by providing positive feedback.</p><p>Public Trello board: (no longer available)</p>",

Mr. Crockford makes it clear, at least to me, that writing software is hard work; and I couldn't agree more.</p><p>Recently I been trying to update my skills to include modern web and mobile development.  Now, I say modern web because I've been doing web development for years but never fully understanding and applying the separation of concerns that are provided with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.  And, not until recently have I been concerned with my websites being responsive.</p><p>Getting up to speed with the newest incarnation of these technologies and methodologies is taking me longer than anticipated, and it definitely takes work and effort to get it right.  But the satisfaction of getting it right once in a while or solving a problem makes it all worth the effort.</p><p>So how does 'Hard Work' === 'Fun'?  The only way that I can explain it is by comparing it to the joy of ridding a bicycle 60 miles without stopping (something I do once a year at a family event): it's hard and painful but at the end the feeling of accomplishment makes it all worth the while.</p>",

This year I decided to take a second look and see if I’m missing anything by mostly ignoring the platform.  So what better way to get familiar with something but by using it and by doing some research.  And here is a summary of what I have found:</p><p>Twitter is used by most major broadcasting companies in the world.  Those include television, cable, radio, news, etc.  The government and most of the politicians in the US have Twitter accounts.  Twitter has been instrumental in most of the recent popular movements, and it has become one of the preferred methods to disseminate information to members of the movement and to the world.  I don’t have the actual facts about this one but I’ll go out on a limb and say that most major corporations have Twitter accounts.  And without a doubt most public figures such as actors, singers, reporters, and the like, have accounts – some to their detriment.  Maybe all of these facts are obvious to most but I never really cared or paid any attention to it.</p><p>So why am I talking about it today?  Because of something that happened in the last 24 hours: I posted a comment on Twitter that was retweeted to more than 103,900 twitter members, and it was favorited by six people that have a combined total of more than 700 followers.  So what does this mean?  It means that there is huge potential in the possibility of reaching beyond our inner circles.  And if that means anything to you, then you should consider getting to know Twitter.</p><p>If you do create a Twitter account don’t forget to ad @abelgaxiola and @familiagaxiola to your Following list.</p>",

In the past I used a couple of other image/photo sharing sites such as Google’s Picasa and another that I can’t even remember the name. I also use Facebook, DropBox, and Windows Live accounts for photo sharing but they are not in the same league or category of sites whose primary line of business is storing photos and images.</p><p>Recently, in the last couple of weeks, I have been uploading some of my photos to my Flickr account and have to admit that even though the learning process has not been without frustration I’m mostly happy and highly recommend Flickr. Now, the service is not perfect, and the web interface is not intuitive, but things can be figured out; and once you figure it out is pretty much a walk in the park from there on.</p><p>If you are thinking about using Flickr for your photos here are a few words of advice:</p><p><b>If you are thinking about using Flickr for your photos here are a few words of advice:</b></p><p>Always create a set with the pictures you upload as soon as you upload them. Why? Because it makes it a lot easier to select the pictures you want to include in your set by simply selecting (filtering) all the pictures in your photostream that are not in a set. (Photostream is the section where all the photos belonging to your account are displayed).</p><p>Give your photos a name before you upload them. Most cameras give the photos names such as GWS234568 or something similar that mean very little to us humans. I rename all my photos using the name of the occasion, the date, or both.</p><p>Keep track of those photos you have uploaded by either moving them into a separate folder or just by making a note of which was the last photo that was uploaded (assuming they are in some type of order). Do this so that you don’t have to deal with the frustration of figuring out which set of photos you were uploading when the computer froze or the connection timed out, etc.</p><p>Organize your photos in collections. Collections can contain other collections and also sets – analogous to folder structures in the file directory of the computer.</p><p>Limit sets to no more than 200 photos if you can. I initially created a set with 400+ photos and I noticed that this particular set would take longer to load than the other smaller sets.</p><p>Organize you collections and sets by clicking on the ellipsis (three dots) in the right hand side of your account page, selecting the Organize option, then selecting the (Sets & Collections) tab. Maybe it’s just me, but it took me time to figure out how to access this option.</p><p>I guess I can keep on going but I’ll finish by sharing my photos so you can get an idea of what I’m talking about.</p><p><a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/abelgaxiola/' target='_blank'>http://www.flickr.com/photos/abelgaxiola/</a></p>",

This also has become a tradition and is now the starting place for the 100 km bicycle ride to Kino Bay. And so the Tour portion of the reunion got started. Not too many riders this year – eight in total – but the spirit to participate and compete was there. A little over three and a half hours later with only 200 meters remaining there was a sprint to the finish line and thanks to Jeff Farmer, Pancho Cuamea, and a good pair of legs I finished in first place.</p><p>The entire day was a success. We had live music playing, plenty to eat and drink, and above all lots of love and kindness. We were all hoping that our beloved Palle would be able to make it to the reunion this year but unfortunately he was not feeling well and was not able to make it. Trophies were awarded to the first three places and a plaque recognizing Palle’s many years sponsoring and coordinating the family event was awarded to those members of his family that were present.</p><p>Sunday was a repeat: more live music, food and drink, and… plenty of love and kindness. Sunday is also the day when many have to leave and return to their homes. I know that many of those I said goodbye to I will not see again until next year – maybe and maybe not. I’m just glad I was able to see them and spend some time with them in fellowship this year</p><p>There are pictures and videos on-line.

Last time I did anything having to do with similar technology was when MS was promoting Azure by offering limited free accounts.  I remember being very excited and quickly signing up for my free account.  Azure was fun and I did learn some new concepts but was never able to justify converting my free account to a pay account – at least not for my personal consumption.</p><p>Well, I don’t have to justify anything anymore.  AppHarbor’s website greets you with the following words: Azure done right.  And after spending some hours working with it I have to conclude that this is indeed the truth.  Disclaimer: I haven’t revisited Azure recently but the last time I checked it was still not free (there is a free 90 days trial but you need a credit card to create the account – you can guess what happens after the 90 days).</p><p>If you are a .NET developer and are looking to leverage the power and flexibility of cloud computing allow me to suggest you take a look at AppHarbor and what it has to offer.  Here is my short list of what impressed me the most about AppHarbor.<br/>Extremely fast deployment of .NET solutions.<br/>Integrates with BitBucket in a seamless manner<br/>Free application hosting<br/>Free SQL Server DB (20 MB</p><p>I have to admit that deploying my first app to the cloud via AppHarbor was not as easy as some articles make it to be, but after I was able to resolve my issues the simplicity of deploying became clear.  I have a new perspective regarding the tools and the deployment cycle; from using TortoiseHg, to versioning in the cloud (BitBucket), and automatically deploying to AppHarbor.  The fruits of my labor are nothing to brag about but the learning experience was priceless.</p><p>My advice: don't wait another day and take a look at the cloud solution today.</p>",

My reason for wanting to get rid of cable TV was twofold: I wanted to cut down on watching TV, and couldn’t justify the cost benefit ratio.",

My reason for wanting to get rid of cable TV was twofold: I wanted to cut down on watching TV, and couldn’t justify the cost benefit ratio.</p><p>I’m a news junkie – mostly political news – and can spend hours a day watching nothing but news channels such as Fox, CNN, and PBS – and the Sunday News/Political commentary shows on the alphabet channels (ABC, NBC, and CBS).  And for the most part that was all I ever watched on a regular basis; nothing else.  No movies, no TV programs – well, maybe a Seinfeld rerun once in a while – no sports, nothing.  So, in my mind paying $70.00 a month for basic cable subscription to watch news over and over, news that I could probably read on the internet was not worth it and was wasting my time.</p><p>Now I have a device called Roku (http://www.roku.com ).  No more paying for 100+ channels I’m not interested in.  Currently I only pay $8.00 a month for a Netflix subscription that streams movies and other videos via my Roku.  I justify this monthly subscription because I was spending that much renting $1.00 movies at Red Box kiosks and other places.  Now I have lot’s more to choose from and I don’t pay late fees.  I also use Roku to stream music via Pandora, and use it to watch free technology channels such as TWiT.tv, YUI Theater, CNET, and more.</p><p>Before I decided to go with Roku I did some research and found that there are many similar devices.  After spending many hours comparing features and reading reviews I decided to go ahead and spend $99.99 for the high end version – and I’m glad I did.  This device was the only one that supported the 1080p HD quality via an HDMI cable, and had a USB port.  That was two months ago.  Today there are newer versions called ROKU 2 with more features and for the same prices.  The most expensive device is still $99.99 but it now includes a free full edition of Angry Birds and it has an Ethernet port.  Now you can get one that supports the 1080p HD for $79.99.  Maybe I’ll buy a new one for the bedroom.</p><p>In summary: I’m not watching as much news and political commentaries as before – a good thing.  And I’m not spending $70.00 a month on cable TV.  I really miss FOX and CNN, but now I get to spend more time doing other things such as reading, working on my websites, and blogging.  Now, if I could just stop playing Angry Birds….</p>",
